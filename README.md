## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### What is Graphed?

Graphed is a website and (PWA) app that makes checking HAC easier and allows you to get more stats about your grade history.
Along with making accessing HAC easier, we also added customizabillity to let our app be just what you want it to be.

### Will my grades be secure?

Absolutely, having ethics show in our code is one of our highest concerns and if we do need to store any data, such as nicknames or prefrences, then we will store the data locally within your device.

### Will there ever be any sort of advertisements or paywalls?

No, our goal is to make our users happy (after all, we're using graphed too!), so there will be no ads or paywalls at all.
However, if you wish to support us, then you still can't pay us, although you can tell your friends about this app!
